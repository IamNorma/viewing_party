### About this Project - Travis

In this project we were expected to build an app where a user can register and create viewing parties involving a movie of their choice. The app has the following features;

Note: think about putting a gif of each of the following pieces below the description<br>

<br>
-a user can search through a list of 40 movies (taken from [theMovieDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/)<br>
-a user can then click on a movie, and see details such as; that movie's title, the cast, etc.<br>

### Learning Goals - Norma



## Local Setup

1. Make sure you have the correct Ruby version installed (2.5.3). To check your Ruby version, from your command line, run `ruby -v`
  - If you do not have the correct version, follow the instructions to install 2.5.3: from the command line, run `rbenv install 2.5.3`
2. Make sure you have the correct Rails version installed (5.2.4.3). To check your Rails version, from your command line, run `rails -v`
  - If you do not have the correct Rails version, [follow these instructions to install 2.5.4.3](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/task_manager_rails/blob/master/rails_uninstall.md)
3. Fork and Clone the repo
4. Install gem packages: `bundle install`
5. Setup the database: `rails db:create`
6. You will need to sign up for an API key through [theMovieDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/)
7. From the command line, run `bundle exec figaro install`. By running this command, rails will create an application.yml file under your config folder. Open up that file, and paste your API key in by following this format: MOVIE_API_KEY: 'your api key here'
8. Once inside the project directory, run `bundle exec rspec`. You should have 800 passing tests
